 - [PAD+ infrastructure](https://github.com/e-PSHAD/pad-infra): technical scripts to help deploy a PAD+ infrastructure

## Editing the Documentation

Documentation pages are stored as files in the `docs` folder and subfolders (for categories). They use the [Markdown format](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features) and can be edited in any text editor.

You can either:
- [edit a file directly through GitHub(https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files)]
- or clone the repository locally, edit it, then commit and push your changes

```
git clone https://github.com/e-PSHAD/pad-doc
```

Once changes have been made with your favorite text editor:
```
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin main
```

The repository is configured to update the [doc website](https://e-pshad.github.io/pad-doc/) on main push. Specifically, the [deploy workflow](https://github.com/e-PSHAD/pad-doc/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) is a GitHub Action which will run Docusaurus build task and publish the site on GitHub Pages.
